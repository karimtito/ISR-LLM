I have 3 blocks. Initially: Block b1 is on the table. Block b2 is on top of b3. Block b3 is on the table. Your goal is to move the blocks such that they are stacked in the order: b2 on b1, b1 on b3, and b3 on table.

Action Sequence:
We need to build the blocks from bottom to top.
Third goal: b3 on table
Already satisfied in initial configuration
Second goal: b1 on b3
(unstack b2 b3)
(putdown b2)
(pickup b1)
(stack b1 b3)
First goal: b2 on b1
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b1)
