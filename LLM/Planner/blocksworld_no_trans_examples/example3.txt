I have 3 blocks. Initially: Block b1 is on top of b3. Block b2 is on the table. Block b3 is on the table. Your goal is to move the blocks such that they are stacked in the order: b2 on b1, b1 on b3, and b3 on table.

Action Sequence:
We need to build the blocks from bottom to top.
Third goal: b3 on table
Already satisfied in initial configuration
Second goal: b1 on b3
Already satisfied in initial configuration
First goal: b2 on b1
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b1)
