I have 4 blocks. Initially: Block b1 is on the table. Block b2 is on top of b4. Block b3 is on top of b1. Block b4 is on the table. Your goal is to move the blocks such that they are stacked in the order: b3 on b2, b2 on b1, b1 on b4, and b4 on table. 

Action Sequence:
We need to build the blocks from bottom to top.
Fourth goal: b4 on table
Already satisfied in initial configuration
Third goal: b1 on b4
(unstack b2 b4)
(putdown b2)
(unstack b3 b1)
(putdown b3)
(pickup b1)
(stack b1 b4)
Second goal: b2 on b1
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b1)
First goal: b3 on b2
(pickup b3)
(stack b3 b2)
