I have 4 pots and 6 different ingredients. Each ingredient can only be picked up once. Your goal is to add ingredients to pots by following the receipts: pot1 contains ingredient2, ingredient6. pot2 contains ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient5. pot3 contains ingredient5, ingredient6. pot4 contains ingredient2, ingredient4, ingredient6.

Action Sequence:
Step 1: ingredient1 is needed in pot2
(pick ingredient1)
(add ingredient1 pot2)
(putdown ingredient1)
Step 2: ingredient2 is needed in pot1, pot2, pot4
(pick ingredient2)
(add ingredient2 pot1)
(add ingredient2 pot2)
(add ingredient2 pot4)
(putdown ingredient2)
Step 3: ingredient3 is not needed in any pot
no action needed
Step 4: ingredient4 is needed in pot4
(pick ingredient4)
(add ingredient4 pot4)
(putdown ingredient4)
Step 5: ingredient5 is needed in pot2, pot3
(pick ingredient5)
(add ingredient5 pot2)
(add ingredient5 pot3)
(putdown ingredient5)
Step 6: ingredient6 is needed in pot1, pot3, pot4
(pick ingredient6)
(add ingredient6 pot1)
(add ingredient6 pot3)
(add ingredient6 pot4)
(putdown ingredient6)
All ingredients have been added to the corresponding pots.
