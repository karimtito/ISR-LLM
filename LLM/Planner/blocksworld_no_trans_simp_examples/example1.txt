I have 4 blocks. Initially: Block b1 is on the table. Block b2 is on top of b4. Block b3 is on top of b1. Block b4 is on the table. Your goal is to move the blocks such that they are stacked in the order: b3 on b2, b2 on b1, b1 on b4, and b4 on table. 

Action Sequence:
(unstack b2 b4)
(putdown b2)
(unstack b3 b1)
(putdown b3)
(pickup b1)
(stack b1 b4)
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b1)
(pickup b3)
(stack b3 b2)
