Action Sequence:
Step 1: 
robot1 is now in room3. 
(at ball1 room1) with goal (at ball1 room3)
(at ball2 room3) with goal (at ball2 room2)
(at ball3 room1) with goal (at ball3 room4)
(at ball4 room2) with goal (at ball4 room4)
ball1 is unsatisfied, ball2 is unsatisfied, ball3 is unsatisfied, ball4 is unsatisfied.
ball2 is in the same room with the robot1 and is unsatisfied.
Go to complete ball2 
(pick ball2 room3)
(move robot1 room3 room2)
(drop ball2 room2)
Step 2:
robot1 is now in room2. 
(at ball1 room1) with goal (at ball1 room3)
(at ball2 room2) with goal (at ball2 room2)
(at ball3 room1) with goal (at ball3 room4)
(at ball4 room2) with goal (at ball4 room4)
ball1 is unsatisfied, ball2 is satisfied, ball3 is unsatisfied, ball4 is unsatisfied.
ball4 is in the same room with the robot1 and is unsatisfied.
Go to complete ball4 
(pick ball4 room2)
(move robot1 room2 room4)
(drop ball4 room4)
Step 3:
robot1 is now in room4.
(at ball1 room1) with goal (at ball1 room3)
(at ball2 room2) with goal (at ball2 room2)
(at ball3 room1) with goal (at ball3 room4)
(at ball4 room4) with goal (at ball4 room4)
ball1 is unsatisfied, ball2 is satisfied, ball3 is unsatisfied, ball4 is satisfied.
All balls that are in the same room with robot1 are satisfied.
Go to complete next unsatisfied ball (from first to last): ball1 
(move robot1 room4 room1)
(pick ball1 room1)
(move robot1 room1 room3)
(drop ball1 room3)
Step 4:
robot1 is now in room3.
(at ball1 room3) with goal (at ball1 room3)
(at ball2 room2) with goal (at ball2 room2)
(at ball3 room1) with goal (at ball3 room4)
(at ball4 room4) with goal (at ball4 room4)
ball1 is satisfied, ball2 is satisfied, ball3 is unsatisfied, ball4 is satisfied.
All balls that are in the same room with robot1 are satisfied.
Go to complete next unsatisfied ball (from first to last): ball3 
(move robot1 room3 room1)
(pick ball3 room1)
(move robot1 room1 room4)
(drop ball3 room4)
Step 5:
robot1 is now in room4.
(at ball1 room3) with goal (at ball1 room3)
(at ball2 room2) with goal (at ball2 room2)
(at ball3 room4) with goal (at ball3 room4)
(at ball4 room4) with goal (at ball4 room4)
ball1 is satisfied, ball2 is satisfied, ball3 is satisfied, ball4 is satisfied.
All balls are satisfied.
