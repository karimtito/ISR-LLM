Action Sequence:
Step 1: 
robot1 is now in room2. 
(at ball1 room2) with goal (at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room2) with goal (at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room4) with goal (at ball3 room1)
ball1 is satisfied, ball2 is unsatisfied, ball3 is unsatisfied.
ball2 is in the same room with the robot1 and is unsatisfied.
Go to complete ball2 
(pick ball2 room2)
(move robot1 room2 room1)
(drop ball2 room1)
Step 2:
robot1 is now in room1. 
(at ball1 room2) with goal (at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room1) with goal (at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room4) with goal (at ball3 room1)
ball1 is satisfied, ball2 is satisfied, ball3 is unsatisfied.
All balls that are in the same room with robot1 are satisfied.
Go to complete next unsatisfied ball (from first to last): ball3 
(move robot1 room1 room4)
(pick ball3 room4)
(move robot1 room4 room1)
(drop ball3 room1)
Step 3:
robot1 is now in room1.
(at ball1 room2) with goal (at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room1) with goal (at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room1) with goal (at ball3 room1)
ball1 is satisfied, ball2 is satisfied, ball3 is satisfied.
All balls are satisfied.
