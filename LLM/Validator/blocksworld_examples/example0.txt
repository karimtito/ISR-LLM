Question:
Block initial state: 
(on-table b1)
(on b2 b1)
(on b3 b2)
Goal state:
(on b1 b2)
(on b2 b3)
(on-table b3)
Examined action sequence:
(unstack b3 b2)
(putdown b3)
(unstack b2 b1)
(putdown b2)
(unstack b1 b2)
(putdown b1)

Answer:
Analysis:
Initial: b1 on the table, b2 on b1, b3 on b2
(unstack b3 b2) result: b1 on the table, b2 on b1, b3 in the hand
(putdown b3) result: b1 on the table, b2 on b1, b3 on the table
(unstack b2 b1) result: b1 on the table, b2 in hand, b3 on the table
(putdown b2) result: b1 on the table, b2 on the table, b3 on the table
(unstack b1 b2) result: the action is wrong since b1 is not on top of b2
analysis stops due to error
Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
