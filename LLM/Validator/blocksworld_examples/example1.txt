Question:
Block initial state: 
(on b1 b3)
(on-table b2)
(on-table b3)
Goal state:

(on-table b1)
Examined action sequence:
(unstack b1 b3)
(putdown b1)
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b1)
(pickup b3)
(stack b3 b2)

Answer:

(unstack b1 b3) result: b1 in hand, b2 on the table, b3 on the table
(putdown b1) result: b1 on the table, b2 on the table, b3 on the table
(pickup b2) result: b1 on the table, b2 in hand, b3 on the table
(stack b2 b1) result: b1 on the table, b2 on b1, b3 on the table
(pickup b3) result: b1 on the table, b2 on b1, b3 in hand
(stack b3 b2) result: b1 on the table, b2 on b1, b3 on b2
