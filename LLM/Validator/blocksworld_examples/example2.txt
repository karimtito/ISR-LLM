Question:
Block initial state: 
(on b1 b3)
(on-table b2)
(on b3 b2)
Goal state:
(on b2 b3)
(on b3 b1)
(on-table b1)
Examined action sequence:
(unstack b1 b3)
(putdown b1)
(unstack b3 b2)
(putdown b3)
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b3)

Answer:
Analysis:
Initial: b1 on b3, b2 on the table, b3 on b2
(unstack b1 b3) result: b1 in hand, b2 on the table, b3 on b2
(putdown b1) result: b1 on the table, b2 on the table, b3 on b2
(unstack b3 b2) result: b1 on the table, b2 on the table, b3 in hand
(putdown b3) result: b1 on the table, b2 on the table, b3 on the table
(pickup b2) result: b1 on the table, b2 in hand, b3 on the table
(stack b2 b3) result: b1 on the table, b2 on b3, b3 on the table
No error found in action sequence.
Goal state check: the final state is not the same as the goal state
Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
