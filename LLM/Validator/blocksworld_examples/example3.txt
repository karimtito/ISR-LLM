Question:
Block initial state: 
(on b1 b3)
(on-table b2)
(on-table b3)
Goal state:
(on b1 b3)
(on b3 b2)
(on-table b2)
Examined action sequence:
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b1)
(pickup b3)
(stack b3 b2)
(pickup b1)
(stack b1 b3)

Answer:
Analysis:
Initial: b1 on b3, b2 on the table, b3 on the table
(pickup b2) result: b1 on b3, b2 in hand, b3 on the table
(stack b2 b1) result: b1 on b3, b2 on b1, b3 on the table
(pickup b3) result: the action is wrong since b3 is not clear to move
analysis stops due to error
Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
