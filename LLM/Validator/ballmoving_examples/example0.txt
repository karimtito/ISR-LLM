Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room1)
(at ball1 room4)
(at ball2 room3)
(at ball3 room4)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room4)
(at ball2 room4)
(at ball3 room3)
Examined action sequence:
(move robot1 room1 room3)
(pick ball2 room3)
(move robot1 room3 room4)
(drop ball2 room3)
(pick ball1 room4)
(move robot1 room4 room3)
(drop ball1 room3)
(pick ball3 room4)
(move robot1 room3 room4)
(drop ball3 room3)

Answer:
Analysis:
Initial state: (robot-at robot1 room1), (at ball1 room4), (at ball2 room3), (at ball3 room4)

(move robot1 room1 room3) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room1)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room1)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room3), (at ball1 room4), (at ball2 room3), (at ball3 room4)

(pick ball2 room3) 
precondition 1: (at ball2 room3)
current state: (at ball2 room3)
current state is the same as the precondition 1
precondition 2: robot1 and ball2 in the same room
current state: (robot-at robot1 room3), (at ball2 room3)
robot1 is in the same room as ball2
two preconditions are correct, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room3), (at ball1 room4), (at ball2 hand), (at ball3 room4)

(move robot1 room3 room4) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room3)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room3)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room4), (at ball1 room4), (at ball2 hand), (at ball3 room4)

(drop ball2 room3) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room3)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room4)
the current state is not the same as the precondition, action is wrong
analysis stops due to error

Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
