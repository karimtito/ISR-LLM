Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room1)
(at ball1 room4)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room1)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room3)
Examined action sequence:
(pick ball3 room1)
(move robot1 room1 room3) 
(drop ball3 room3)
(move robot1 room3 room4) 
(pick ball1 room4) 
(move robot1 room4 room2)
(drop ball1 room2)

Answer:
Analysis:
(pick ball3 room1) 
current state: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room4, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room1
Are robot1 and ball3 both in room1?
Yes.
next state: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room4, ball2 in room1, ball3 in hand

(move robot1 room1 room3) 
current state: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room4, ball2 in room1, ball3 in hand
Is robot1 in room1?
Yes.
next state: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room4, ball2 in room1, ball3 in hand

(drop ball3 room3) 
current state: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room4, ball2 in room1, ball3 in hand
Is robot1 in room3?
Yes.
next state: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room4, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3

(move robot1 room3 room4) 
current state: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room4, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
Is robot1 in room3?
Yes.
next state: robot1 in room4, ball1 in room4, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3

(pick ball1 room4) 
current state: robot1 in room4, ball1 in room4, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
Are robot1 and ball1 both in room4?
Yes.
next state: robot1 in room4, ball1 in hand, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3

(move robot1 room4 room2) 
current state: robot1 in room4, ball1 in hand, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
Is robot1 in room4?
Yes.
next state: robot1 in room2, ball1 in hand, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3

(drop ball1 room2) 
current state: robot1 in room2, ball1 in hand, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
Is robot1 in room2?
Yes.
next state: robot1 in room2, ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3

No error found in action sequence.
Goal state check: 
final state: ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
goal state: ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
The final state is the same as the goal state. The goal is accomplished.

Final answer:
Yes, the action sequence is correct, it can accomplish the task.
