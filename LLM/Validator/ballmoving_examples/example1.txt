Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room1)
(at ball1 room3)
(at ball2 room4)
(at ball3 room2)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room3)
(at ball3 room1)
Examined action sequence:
(pick ball2 room4)
(move robot1 room2 room3)
(drop ball2 room3)
(move robot1 room3 room2)
(pick ball1 room3)
(move robot1 room2 room1)
(drop ball1 room2)
(move robot1 room1 room2)
(pick ball3 room2)
(move robot1 room2 room1)
(drop ball3 room1)

Answer:
Analysis:
Initial state: (robot-at robot1 room1), (at ball1 room3), (at ball2 room4), (at ball3 room2)

(pick ball2 room4) 
precondition 1: (at ball2 room4)
current state: (at ball2 room4)
current state is the same as the precondition 1
precondition 2: robot1 and ball2 in the same room
current state: (robot-at robot1 room1), (at ball2 room4)
robot1 is not in the same room as ball2
preconditions are not fullfilled, action is wrong
analysis stops due to error

Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
