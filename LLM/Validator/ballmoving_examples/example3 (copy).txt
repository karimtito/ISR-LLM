No error found in action sequence.
Goal state check: 
final state: ball1 in room3, ball2 in room4, ball3 in room3
goal state: ball1 in room3, ball2 in room4, ball3 in room4
The final state is not the same as the goal state. The goal is not accomplished.

Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
