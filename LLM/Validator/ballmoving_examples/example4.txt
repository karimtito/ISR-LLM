Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room1)
(at ball1 room4)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room1)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room3)
Examined action sequence:
(pick ball3 room1)
(move robot1 room1 room3) 
(drop ball3 room3)
(move robot1 room3 room4) 
(pick ball1 room4) 
(move robot1 room4 room2)
(drop ball1 room2)

Answer:
Analysis:
Initial state: (robot-at robot1 room1), (at ball1 room4), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 room1)

(pick ball3 room1) 
precondition 1: (at ball3 room1)
current state: (at ball3 room1)
current state is the same as the precondition 1
precondition 2: robot1 and ball3 in the same room
current state: (robot-at robot1 room1), (at ball3 room1)
robot1 is in the same room as ball1
two preconditions are correct, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room1), (at ball1 room4), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 hand)

(move robot1 room1 room3) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room1)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room1)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room3), (at ball1 room4), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 hand)

(drop ball3 room3) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room3)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room3)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room3), (at ball1 room4), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 room3)

(move robot1 room3 room4) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room3)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room3)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room4), (at ball1 room4), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 room3)

(pick ball1 room4) 
precondition 1: (at ball1 room4)
current state: (at ball1 room4)
current state is the same as the precondition 1
precondition 2: robot1 and ball1 in the same room
current state: (robot-at robot1 room4), (at ball1 room4)
robot1 is in the same room as ball1
two preconditions are correct, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room4), (at ball1 hand), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 room3)

(move robot1 room4 room2) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room4)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room4)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to:  (robot-at robot1 room2), (at ball1 hand), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 room3)

(drop ball1 room2) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room2)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room2)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to:  (robot-at robot1 room2), (at ball1 room2), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 room3)

No error found in action sequence.
Goal state check: 
final state: (at ball1 room2), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 room3)
goal state: (at ball1 room2), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 room3)
The final state is the same as the goal state. The goal is accomplished.

Final answer:
Yes, the action sequence is correct, it can accomplish the task.
