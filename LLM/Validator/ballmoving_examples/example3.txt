Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room4)
(at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room4)
(at ball3 room3)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room3)
(at ball2 room4)
(at ball3 room4)
Examined action sequence:
(move robot1 room4 room2)
(pick ball1 room2)
(move robot1 room2 room3)
(drop ball1 room3)

Answer:
Analysis:
Initial state: (robot-at robot1 room4), (at ball1 room2), (at ball2 room4), (at ball3 room3)

(move robot1 room4 room2) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room4)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room4)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room2), (at ball1 room2), (at ball2 room4), (at ball3 room3)

(pick ball1 room2) 
precondition 1: (at ball1 room2)
current state: (at ball1 room2)
current state is the same as the precondition 1
precondition 2: robot1 and ball1 in the same room
current state: (robot-at robot1 room2), (at ball1 room2)
robot1 is in the same room as ball1
two preconditions are correct, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room2), (at ball1 hand), (at ball2 room4), (at ball3 room3)

(move robot1 room2 room3) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room2)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room2)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room3), (at ball1 hand), (at ball2 room4), (at ball3 room3)

(drop ball1 room3) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room3)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room3)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room3), (at ball1 room3), (at ball2 room4), (at ball3 room3)

No error found in action sequence.
Goal state check: 
final state: (at ball1 room3), (at ball2 room4), (at ball3 room3)
goal state: (at ball1 room3), (at ball2 room4), (at ball3 room4)
The final state is not the same as the goal state. The goal is not accomplished.

Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
