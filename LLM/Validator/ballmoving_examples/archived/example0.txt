Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room1)
(at ball1 room4)
(at ball2 room3)
(at ball3 room4)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room4)
(at ball2 room4)
(at ball3 room3)
Examined action sequence:
(move robot1 room1 room3)
(pick ball2 room3)
(move robot1 room3 room4)
(drop ball2 room4)
(pick ball1 room4)
(move robot1 room4 room3)
(drop ball1 room3)
(pick ball3 room4)
(move robot1 room3 room4)
(drop ball3 room3)

Answer:
Analysis:
Goal: ball1 in room4, ball2 in room4, ball3 in room3
Initial: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room4 (satisfied), ball2 in room3 (unsatisfied), ball3 in room4 (unsatisfied)

Check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
No. Therefore, the target should be the first unsatisfied ball, which is ball2.
The next pick target is ball2, so the target is correct.

(move robot1 room1 room3) 
result: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room4 (satisfied), ball2 in room3 (unsatisfied), ball3 in room4 (unsatisfied)
(pick ball2 room3)
result: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room4 (satisfied), ball2 in hand (unsatisfied), ball3 in room4 (unsatisfied)
(move robot1 room3 room4) 
result: robot1 in room4, ball1 in room4 (satisfied), ball2 in hand (unsatisfied), ball3 in room4 (unsatisfied)
(drop ball2 room4) 
result: robot1 in room4, ball1 in room4 (satisfied), ball2 in room4 (satisfied), ball3 in room4 (unsatisfied)

Check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
Yes, ball3. Therefore, the target should be ball3.
The next pick target is ball1, so the target is wrong.
analysis stops due to error

(pick ball1 room4) 
for pick we need to check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
Yes, ball3.
ball3 is not the same target in current pick action, target is wrong.
result: the action is wrong since robot1 should first move ball3
analysis stops due to error

Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
