Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room1)
(at ball1 room4)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room1)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room3)
Examined action sequence:
(move robot1 room1 room4)
(pick ball1 room4)
(move robot1 room4 room2)
(drop ball1 room2)
(move robot1 room2 room1)
(pick ball3 room1)
(move robot1 room1 room3)
(drop ball3 room3)

Answer:
Analysis:
Goal: ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
Initial: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in room1 (unsatisfied)

(move robot1 room1 room4) 
result: robot1 in room4, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in room1 (unsatisfied)

(pick ball1 room4)
for pick we need to check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
Yes, ball1.
ball1 is the same target in current pick action, target is correct. 



\result: robot1 in room4, ball1 in hand, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room1
(move robot1 room4 room2) result: robot1 in room2, ball1 in hand, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room1
(drop ball1 room2) result: robot1 in room2, ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room1
(move robot1 room2 room1) result: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room1
(pick ball3 room1) result: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in hand
(move robot1 room1 room3) result: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in hand
(drop ball3 room3) result: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
No error found in action sequence.
The final state is: ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
The goal state is: ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
So, the final state is the same as the goal state
Final answer:
Yes, the action sequence is correct, it can accomplish the task.
