Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room4)
(at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room4)
(at ball3 room3)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room3)
(at ball2 room4)
(at ball3 room4)
Examined action sequence:
(move robot1 room4 room2)
(pick ball1 room2)
(move robot1 room2 room3)
(drop ball1 room3)

Answer:
Analysis:
Goal: ball1 in room3, ball2 in room4, ball3 in room4
Initial: robot1 in room4, ball1 in room2 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room4 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (unsatisfied)

(move robot1 room4 room2) 
result: robot1 in room2, ball1 in room2 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room4 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (unsatisfied)

(pick ball1 room2) 
for pick we need to check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
Yes, ball1.
ball1 is the same target in current pick action, target is correct.
result: robot1 in room2, ball1 in hand (unsatisfied), ball2 in room4 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (unsatisfied)

(move robot1 room2 room3) 
result: robot1 in room3, ball1 in hand (unsatisfied), ball2 in room4 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (unsatisfied)

(drop ball1 room3) 
result: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room3 (satisfied), ball2 in room4 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (unsatisfied)

No error found in action sequence.
Goal state check: 
Not all balls are satisfied, goal state is not accomplished.

Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
