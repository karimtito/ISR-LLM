Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room2)
(at ball1 room4)
(at ball2 room2)
(at ball3 room4)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room1)
(at ball2 room4)
(at ball3 room2)
Examined action sequence:
(pick ball2 room2)
(move robot1 room2 room4)
(drop ball2 room4)
(move robot1 room4 room1)
(pick ball1 room4)
(move robot1 room1 room2)
(drop ball1 room2)
(move robot1 room2 room4)
(pick ball3 room4)
(move robot1 room4 room2)
(drop ball3 room2)

Answer:
Analysis:
Goal: ball1 in room1, ball2 in room4, ball3 in room2
Initial: robot1 in room2, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room2 (unsatisfied), ball3 in room4 (unsatisfied)

(pick ball2 room2) 
for pick we need to check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
Yes, ball2.
ball2 is the same target in current pick action, target is correct.
result: robot1 in room2, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in hand (unsatisfied), ball3 in room4 (unsatisfied)

(move robot1 room2 room4) 
result: robot1 in room4, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in hand (unsatisfied), ball3 in room4 (unsatisfied)

(drop ball2 room4) 
result: robot1 in room4, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room4 (satisfied), ball3 in room4 (unsatisfied)

(move robot1 room4 room1) 
result: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room4 (satisfied), ball3 in room4 (unsatisfied)

(pick ball1 room4) 
for pick we need to check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
No. Therefore, the target should be the first unsatisfied ball, which is ball1.
ball1 is the same target in current pick action, target is correct.
result: the action is wrong since robot1 is not in room4
analysis stops due to error

Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
