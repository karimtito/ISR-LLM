Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room1)
(at ball1 room3)
(at ball2 room4)
(at ball3 room2)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room3)
(at ball3 room1)
Examined action sequence:
(pick ball2 room4)
(move robot1 room2 room3)
(drop ball2 room3)
(move robot1 room3 room2)
(pick ball1 room3)
(move robot1 room2 room1)
(drop ball1 room2)
(move robot1 room1 room2)
(pick ball3 room2)
(move robot1 room2 room1)
(drop ball3 room1)

Answer:
Analysis:
Goal: ball1 in room2, ball2 in room3, ball3 in room1
Initial: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room3 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball3 in room2 (unsatisfied)

(pick ball2 room4) 
for pick we need to check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
No. Therefore, the target should be the first unsatisfied ball, which is ball1.
ball1 is not the same target in current pick action, target is wrong.
result: the action is wrong since robot1 should first move ball1
analysis stops due to error

Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
