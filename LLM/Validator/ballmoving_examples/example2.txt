Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room2)
(at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room3)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room1)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room3)
Examined action sequence:
(move robot1 room2 room1)
(pick ball1 room1)
(move robot1 room1 room2)
(drop ball1 room2)
(pick ball2 room1)
(move robot1 room2 room1)
(drop ball2 room1)

Answer:
Analysis:
Initial state: (robot-at robot1 room2), (at ball1 room2), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 room3)

(move robot1 room2 room1) 
precondition: (robot-at robot1 room2)
current state: (robot-at robot1 room2)
current state is the same as the precondition, action is correct
change state to: (robot-at robot1 room1), (at ball1 room2), (at ball2 room1), (at ball3 room3)

(pick ball1 room1) 
precondition 1: (at ball1 room1)
current state: (at ball1 room2)
current state is not the same as the precondition 1
preconditions are not fullfilled, action is wrong
analysis stops due to error

Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
