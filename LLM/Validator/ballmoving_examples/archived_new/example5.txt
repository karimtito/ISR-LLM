Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room1)
(at ball1 room4)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room1)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room3)
Examined action sequence:
(pick ball3 room1)
(move robot1 room1 room3) 
(drop ball3 room3)
(move robot1 room3 room4) 
(pick ball1 room4) 
(move robot1 room4 room2)
(drop ball1 room2)

Answer:
Analysis:
Goal: ball1 in room2, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
Initial: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in room1 (unsatisfied)

Check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
Yes, ball3. Therefore, the target should be ball3.
The next pick target is ball3, so the target is correct.

(pick ball3 room1)
result: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in hand (unsatisfied)
(move robot1 room1 room3) 
result: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in hand (unsatisfied)
(drop ball3 room3)
result: robot1 in room3, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (satisfied)

Check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
No. Therefore, the target should be the first unsatisfied ball, which is ball1.
The next pick target is ball1, so the target is correct.

(move robot1 room3 room4) 
result: robot1 in room4, ball1 in room4 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (satisfied)
(pick ball1 room4) 
result: robot1 in room4, ball1 in hand (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (satisfied)
(move robot1 room4 room2)
result: robot1 in room2, ball1 in hand (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (satisfied)
(drop ball1 room2)
result: robot1 in room2, ball1 in room2 (satisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (satisfied)

No error found in action sequence.
Goal state check: 
All balls are satisfied, goal state is accomplished.

Final answer:
Yes, the action sequence is correct, it can accomplish the task.
