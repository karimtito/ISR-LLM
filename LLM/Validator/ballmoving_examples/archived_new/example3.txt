Question:
Robot and ball initial state: 
(robot-at robot1 room2)
(at ball1 room2)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room3)
Goal state:
(at ball1 room1)
(at ball2 room1)
(at ball3 room3)
Examined action sequence:
(move robot1 room2 room1)
(pick ball1 room1)
(move robot1 room1 room2)
(drop ball1 room2)
(pick ball2 room1)
(move robot1 room2 room1)
(drop ball2 room1)

Answer:
Analysis:
Goal: ball1 in room1, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3
Initial: robot1 in room2, ball1 in room2 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (satisfied)

Check target:
Is there unsatisfied balls in the same room as the robot1?
Yes, ball1. Therefore, the target should be ball1.
The next pick target is ball1, so the target is correct.

(move robot1 room2 room1) 
result: robot1 in room1, ball1 in room2 (unsatisfied), ball2 in room1 (satisfied), ball3 in room3 (satisfied)
(pick ball1 room1) 
result: the action is wrong since ball1 is not in room1
analysis stops due to error

Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
