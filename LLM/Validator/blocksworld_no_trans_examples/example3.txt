Question:
I have 3 blocks. Initially: Block b1 is on top of b3. Block b2 is on the table. Block b3 is on the table. Your goal is to move the blocks such that they are stacked in the order: b1 on b3, b3 on b2, and b2 on table.
Examined action sequence:
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b1)
(pickup b3)
(stack b3 b2)
(pickup b1)
(stack b1 b3)

Answer:
Analysis:
Initial: b1 on b3, b2 on the table, b3 on the table
(pickup b2) result: b1 on b3, b2 in hand, b3 on the table
(stack b2 b1) result: b1 on b3, b2 on b1, b3 on the table
(pickup b3) result: the action is wrong since b3 is not clear to move
analysis stops due to error
Final answer:
No, the action sequence is wrong, it cannot accomplish the goal.
