Question:
I have 3 blocks. Initially: Block b1 is on top of b3. Block b2 is on the table. Block b3 is on the table. Your goal is to move the blocks such that they are stacked in the order: b3 on b2, b2 on b1, and b1 on table.
Examined action sequence:
(unstack b1 b3)
(putdown b1)
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b1)
(pickup b3)
(stack b3 b2)

Answer:
Analysis:
Initial: b1 on b3, b2 on the table, b3 on the table
(unstack b1 b3) result: b1 in hand, b2 on the table, b3 on the table
(putdown b1) result: b1 on the table, b2 on the table, b3 on the table
(pickup b2) result: b1 on the table, b2 in hand, b3 on the table
(stack b2 b1) result: b1 on the table, b2 on b1, b3 on the table
(pickup b3) result: b1 on the table, b2 on b1, b3 in hand
(stack b3 b2) result: b1 on the table, b2 on b1, b3 on b2
