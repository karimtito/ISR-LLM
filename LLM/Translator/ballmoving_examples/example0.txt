I have 3 balls within 4 rooms. Initially: Robot is in room2. Ball ball1 is in room3. Ball ball2 is in room2. Ball ball3 is in room4. Your goal is to move the balls to specific rooms: ball1 in room1, ball2 in room2, and ball3 in room3.

(define (domain ballmoving)
(:types room ball robot)
(:predicates 
(robot-at ?r - robot ?x - room)
(at ?b - ball ?x - room)
(arm-empty)
(carry ?r -robot ?b - ball)

  :precondition (and (robot-at ?r ?from))
  :effect (and (robot-at ?r ?to) (not (robot-at ?r ?from)))

  :parameters  (?r - robot ?b - ball ?room - room)
  :precondition  (and (at ?b ?room) (robot-at ?r ?room) (arm-empty))

))
(:action drop
